Let's try to do a blog! It's been a while since I want to do that.

github + jekyll seems to be a nice way to start.
English isn't my mother language and I'm not very good at it. Sorry about that, feel free to report errors.

I'm currently using the [contrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) theme. I might write my own, someday, perhaps.

In this blog I will talk about things I want to share. Things I like. Things I did.
It will mostly be about programming, hacking, reversing, hardware, etc.
